  <h2>About this extension</h2>
  {extension_name} is a Burp extension that can be used to perform timing attacks over an unreliable network such as the internet. The attack mode is similar to the "sniper" mode in burp intruder, but instead of sending a single request for every payload, it is able to send multiple requests for each payload and show the minimum and maximum times taken to receive a response as well as showing average times.
  <br><br>
  The extension sends HTTP(S) requests sequentially to reduce the chance affecting the time the server takes to respond by overloading it.
  <h2>Using this extension</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by sending a request to the extension by right clicking on a request anywhere in Burp and choosing "Send To {extension_name}". This will populate the "Target" tab in the extension.</li>
    <li>Select the parts of the request that should be replaced with the payloads then click the "Add Payload At Position" button. This will add symbols at the start and end positions where the payload will be inserted.</li>
    <li>Choose how many requests to make for each payload</li>
    <li>Type or copy/paste the payloads into the "Payloads" text area. Place a single payload on each new line.</li>
    <li>Hit the "Start Attack" button. Results will be displayed in the "Results" tab</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  Extensions such as Logger++ (available from the BApp store) will show requests and responses that have been generated by this extension.

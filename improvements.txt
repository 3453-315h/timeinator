* Fix bug in the colouring of table cells. If there are only two rows (two payloads) and they are put in the table very fast (e.g. they a simple response from a locally hosted web server) and there is no sorting applied to the table, then some of the top row of cells does not become coloured when the second row is rendered.
* Refactor - e.g. move UI building into its own method, etc.
* Error checking of user input (and network errors).
* Fix layout of attack tab. (e.g. Start button sometimes changes sizes)

* Display results in table as they come in, one by one.
* Implement option for parallel requests and throttling.
* Try to find a way of looking for obvious signs of timing attacks being possible (standard deviations?)
* Make it so that a new tab is generated for each new "send to" action, like Intruder and some other extensions.
* Consider storing more accurate values in the data model, and only limiting to 3 decimal places when displaying.
* Load Payloads From file or generate payloads (e.g. list of numbers).
